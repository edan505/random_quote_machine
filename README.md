Freecodecamp's Frontend Certificate Project - Random Quote Machine

Hi! 

This project was built using the following technologies: 
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
VueJS 3 / VueCLI

The idea here was to create a small application that calls a simple API to return random quotes & their respective authors. 
Whenever a quote is rendered, the background, text, and button colors will gradually transition to a different color. 
The colors are randomly selected from a list of HEX values saved in the app.
